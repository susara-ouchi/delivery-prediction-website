“A perfectly cooked meal means nothing if it’s not served on time”. 

In the fast-paced world we live in, food delivery has become more than just a convenience, it’s a solution that brings the flavors of the world to your doorstep, turning every meal into an experience without leaving the comfort of your home.

In the food delivery industry, punctuality transforms this mere service into a seamless culinary experience. Hence, the delivery time, or more precisely on-time delivery, happens to have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and service quality of the delivery company which drives the competition in the industry. Yet, achieving this standard of on-time delivery is not a piece of cake, it is influenced by a lot of internal as well as external factors. 
The summarized analysis given here was based on a rich dataset obtained from Kaggle which included several external and internal factors deemed important to conduct a thorough analysis. 

Hence, the analysis was mainly directed towards addressing two objectives, 
1)	Identifying the factors that have the most significant influence on the food delivery time.
2)	Developing an effective delivery time prediction model that will aid the delivery companies in evaluating their performance showing them necessary directions for improvements
